# pbxtophp
Grandstream PBX phonebook extraction and php parsing.

You can execute a powershell script to extract to a local XML file and transfer it to your webserver and using PHP, 
parse it to show the Names and Extensions of the contacts in the phonelist. This is in the case you would like to 
show a realtime phonebook for company employees.

You can run this script automatically using windows task scheduller in order to maintain a fresh phonebook all the time.
